# Affiliate Networks Explained - How It Works

## **Key Principle: One Network Per Brand**
- You can only be approved on **ONE network** for each brand
- If Jackery approves you on their direct program, you can't also join them on Awin
- Networks are **competing** for the same brands and affiliates

## **Why Multiple Networks Exist for Same Brand**

### **Brand Perspective:**
- **Wider reach**: Different networks have different affiliates
- **Market testing**: Compare performance across networks
- **Risk mitigation**: Don't put all eggs in one basket
- **Geographic focus**: Some networks stronger in different regions

### **Network Perspective:**
- **Competition**: Networks compete to offer brands better services
- **Revenue model**: Networks take 15-30% of commission paid
- **Specialization**: Some networks focus on specific verticals

## **Commission Rate Hierarchy (Why Direct is Best)**

### **Jackery Example:**
- **Direct Program**: 8% (brand pays you directly)
- **Awin/Webgains**: 6% (network takes ~2% cut)
- **Smaller Networks**: 4-5% (take bigger cuts)

### **The Math:**
- **Brand budget**: ¬£10 commission per sale
- **Direct**: You get ¬£8, brand keeps ¬£2
- **Network**: You get ¬£6, network gets ¬£2, brand keeps ¬£2
- **Bad network**: You get ¬£4, network gets ¬£4, brand keeps ¬£2

## **Application Strategy Explained**

### **Step 1: Apply Direct First**
```
Jackery Direct Program ‚Üí 8% commission
‚Üì (if rejected)
Awin Network ‚Üí 6% commission  
‚Üì (if rejected)
Webgains Network ‚Üí 6% commission
‚Üì (last resort)
Smaller networks ‚Üí 3-5% commission
```

### **Why This Order:**
1. **Higher payout** (8% vs 6%)
2. **Better relationship** with brand
3. **Faster payments** (no network middleman)
4. **More flexibility** (custom deals possible)

## **When to Use Networks Instead of Direct**

### **Network Advantages:**
- **One dashboard** for multiple brands
- **Consolidated payments** (all brands pay through one network)
- **Easier management** (one login vs multiple)
- **Built-in tracking** and reporting tools

### **When Networks Make Sense:**
- **Small affiliate**: Brands won't deal direct with small affiliates
- **Multiple brands**: Managing 20+ direct programs is complex
- **International**: Networks handle currency/tax issues
- **Compliance**: Networks ensure legal compliance

## **Jackery Specific Recommendation**

### **What To Do:**
1. **Start with direct application** to Jackery UK
2. **Wait for response** (usually 1-2 weeks)
3. **If approved**: Celebrate, 8% commission! üéâ
4. **If rejected**: Apply to Awin, then Webgains as backup

### **Don't Do:**
- ‚ùå Apply to all networks simultaneously
- ‚ùå Apply to networks before trying direct
- ‚ùå Join Affiliatly unless desperate (lowest rates)
