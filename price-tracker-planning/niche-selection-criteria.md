# Niche Selection Criteria for Price Tracking Sites

## Core Principles

A successful price tracking niche needs the perfect storm of:
1. **High consideration purchases** (people research before buying)
2. **Clear product differentiation** (specs that matter)
3. **Monetisation potential** (decent margins for affiliates/imports)
4. **Manageable competition** (not oversaturated)

## Primary Criteria (Must Have)

### 1. Purchase Psychology
**"Considered Purchase" Profile:**
- People know exactly what they want but will wait for deals
- High enough value that savings matter (£200+ typically)
- Infrequent purchases (not consumables)
- Research-heavy audience who actively seek price comparisons

**Examples:**
- ✅ Power stations: "I want the EcoFlow Delta Pro 3, but £3000 is steep"
- ✅ Camera lenses: "Need 70-200mm f/2.8, waiting for sale"
- ❌ Phone cases: Impulse buy, too cheap to wait

### 2. Product Identification
**Clear Specifications:**
- Unambiguous model numbers/names
- Standardised specifications across brands
- Easy to match same product across retailers
- Minimal variations (size/colour don't fragment market)

**Examples:**
- ✅ Cameras: Canon EOS R5, Sony A7R V (exact models)
- ✅ Guitar pedals: Strymon BigSky, Chase Bliss Mood
- ❌ Generic "wireless earbuds" (too many variants)

### 3. Price Volatility
**Dynamic Pricing:**
- Regular sales and promotions
- Seasonal price patterns
- New model releases affect older model prices
- Street price differs significantly from RRP

**Indicators:**
- End-of-line clearances
- Black Friday participation
- New product launches create price drops on older models

## Secondary Criteria (Highly Desirable)

### 4. Market Size vs Competition
**Sweet Spot Analysis:**
- Large enough market for decent volume
- Not so large that Amazon/big players dominate completely
- Existing competition suggests viable market
- Room for a specialist player

**Assessment Method:**
- Check if existing price comparison sites exist (validates market)
- Look at search volumes for "[product] price comparison"
- Assess how saturated first page Google results are

### 5. Community Engagement
**Passionate Audience:**
- Active forums, Reddit communities, Facebook groups
- YouTube channels dedicated to the niche
- People who discuss purchases extensively
- Brand loyalty and heated debates about specs

**Examples:**
- ✅ Audiophiles: Obsess over specifications, endless debates
- ✅ Photographers: Pixel peep, analyse lens sharpness charts
- ✅ Musicians: Tone chasers, collect multiple similar items

### 6. Affiliate/Revenue Potential
**Monetisation Factors:**
- Decent affiliate commission rates (4%+ minimum)
- High average order values
- Multiple quality affiliate programs available
- Import/manufacturing opportunities visible

**Revenue Calculation:**
- Commission rate × AOV × conversion rate × traffic potential
- Minimum target: £1000/month potential at scale

## Elimination Criteria (Avoid)

### 1. Commoditised Products
- Race to the bottom pricing
- Minimal differentiation between products
- Dominated by price-only competition
- Amazon owns the market completely

### 2. Fast-Moving Technology
- Products become obsolete quickly (6-12 months)
- Constant spec changes make comparisons difficult
- Inventory turns over too quickly for tracking

### 3. Limited Supplier Base
- Only 1-2 major brands
- Very few retailers stock items
- Restrictive distribution agreements
- Limited import opportunities

### 4. Legal/Regulatory Issues
- Age restrictions complicate marketing
- Import duties/regulations complex
- Professional/trade-only products
- Restricted advertising policies

## Evaluation Framework

### Scoring System (1-10 scale)

**Must-Have Criteria (Weighted 2x):**
- Purchase consideration level
- Product differentiation clarity
- Price volatility/deal frequency

**Desirable Criteria (Weighted 1x):**
- Market size vs competition
- Community engagement level
- Revenue potential

**Minimum Total Score:** 35/50 to proceed

### Research Process

1. **Initial Assessment:**
   - Google search volume for "[niche] price comparison"
   - Check existing comparison sites
   - Browse relevant communities (Reddit, forums)

2. **Deep Dive:**
   - Analyse 5-10 popular products in niche
   - Check affiliate programs and commission rates
   - Assess product differentiation complexity

3. **Competition Analysis:**
   - Map existing price comparison players
   - Identify gaps or weaknesses
   - Assess barrier to entry level

## Strategic Considerations

### Portfolio Approach
- Start with 1-2 proven niches
- Expand to complementary categories
- Risk diversification across different customer types

### Seasonal Balance
- Mix of seasonal and year-round products
- Counter-cyclical categories reduce risk
- Holiday shopping vs professional purchasing patterns

### Future Expansion Potential
- Can we eventually import/manufacture?
- Are there related categories to expand into?
- Does success in one area open doors to others?

## Red Flags to Watch For

### Market Warnings
- Declining search trends over 2+ years
- Major retailers exiting the category
- Shift to subscription/service models
- Increasing manufacturer direct sales

### Technical Challenges
- Heavy JavaScript rendering on retailer sites
- Frequent site structure changes
- Anti-scraping measures increasing
- Limited product data availability
