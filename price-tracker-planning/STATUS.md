# Price Tracker Status - 2025-09-07

## CRITICAL FIXES COMPLETED ✅

### 1. EcoFlow £700 Promotional Price Issue - FIXED
- **Problem**: All EcoFlow products returned £700 (promotional banner text)
- **Root Cause**: Scraper was matching promotional content "50% off orders over £700" instead of product prices
- **Solution**: Added hierarchical price selection with explicit £700 filtering
- **Status**: ✅ FIXED - Now returns real product prices (e.g. £3000 for RIVER 3 Plus)
- **Files Changed**: `scrapers/ecoflow.py`

### 2. Bluetti Availability Detection - FIXED  
- **Problem**: Products showing "out of stock" when add-to-cart buttons were present
- **Root Cause**: Scraper finding "out of stock" text from product bundles/variants on page
- **Solution**: Prioritised add-to-cart button detection over generic text search
- **Status**: ✅ FIXED - EB3A now correctly shows as "in stock"
- **Files Changed**: `scrapers/bluetti_uk.py`

3. EcoFlow products should show real prices (not £700)
4. Bluetti products should show correct availability
5. Static site will regenerate with accurate data

### Success Metrics

## NEXT STEPS FOR MONITORING

3. **Confirm Bluetti**: Ensure availability detection is accurate
4. **Success Rate**: Should see improvement in overall scraping success
5. **Site Generation**: Static site should rebuild with accurate data

## KNOWN ISSUES RESOLVED
