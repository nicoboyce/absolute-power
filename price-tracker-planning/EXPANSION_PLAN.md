- Products tracked: 29 (target: 50+)
- Retailers covered: 6 (target: 10+)
- Price points per product: 2-4 (target: 5+)

## Phase 1: Retailer Expansion ðŸŽ¯

### Priority 1: Argos Scraper
- **Target**: Jackery products (confirmed availability)
- **Value**: Major UK retailer, same-day delivery options
- **Implementation**: Create `scrapers/argos.py`
- **Products to add**: All Jackery Explorer series
- **Expected impact**: +20-30 price points

### Priority 2: eBay Official Stores
- **Target**: Bluetti UK Official eBay store
- **Value**: Often competitive pricing, manufacturer-backed
- **Implementation**: Create `scrapers/ebay_official.py`
- **Products to add**: Bluetti EB3A, AC70, AC200L, Elite series
- **Expected impact**: +15-20 price points

### Priority 3: Specialist Retailers
- **Target A**: The Power Outlet (Bluetti authorised dealer)
- **Target B**: Outdoorsupply.co.uk (Goal Zero)
- **Target C**: Alpinetrek.co.uk (Goal Zero)
- **Value**: Better margins on niche products
- **Expected impact**: +10-15 price points

## Phase 2: Product Catalogue Expansion ðŸš€

### Goal Zero Integration (New Brand)
**Missing Market Segment**: Outdoor/camping focused power stations

**Products to Add:**
- Yeti 200X (187Wh, Â£249-299)
- Yeti 500X (505Wh, Â£549-649) 
- Yeti 1000X (983Wh, Â£999-1199)
- Yeti 1500X (1516Wh, Â£1499-1799)
- Yeti 3000X (2982Wh, Â£2999-3499)

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Create Goal Zero product JSON files
2. Build `scrapers/goalzero_uk.py`
3. Add specialist retailer scrapers
4. Update main scraping orchestrator

**Expected Impact:** +25 products, new market segment coverage

### Missing 2025 Models
**High-Priority Additions:**
- Jackery Explorer 500 v2 (coming soon, pre-orders)
- EcoFlow DELTA 3 series (latest release)
- Bluetti Elite 30 V2 (new compact model)
- Bluetti AC200L (2025 flagship)
- Anker SOLIX F3800 expansion bundles

**Expected Impact:** +15-20 current-gen products

## Phase 3: Technical Infrastructure ðŸ”§

### Price Validation System
**Problem**: Promotional banners causing false positives (Â£700 EcoFlow issue)

**Solution Components:**
1. **Price Range Validation**:
   - Min/max thresholds per product category
   - Historical price variance analysis
   - Promotional content filtering

2. **Anomaly Detection**:
   - 50%+ price drops flagged for review
   - Static prices (no change >7 days) monitoring
   - Cross-retailer validation (outlier detection)

3. **Implementation**:
   ```python
   def validate_price(self, price, product_id, historical_data):
       # Range checking
       # Variance analysis  
       # Promotional filtering
   ```

### Headless Browser Reliability
**Problem**: JS-heavy sites failing on Pi deployment

**Current Issues:**
- EcoFlow: Dynamic pricing content
- Bluetti: 404s from code-heavy responses
- Anker: Some product pages load dynamically

**Solutions:**
1. **Playwright Implementation**: Better than Selenium for modern sites
2. **Retry Logic**: Multiple attempts with different strategies
3. **Fallback Chain**: Headless â†’ Standard â†’ Search API
4. **Resource Optimization**: ARM-compatible browser binaries

### Monitoring Dashboard
**Requirement**: Real-time visibility into scraping performance

**Components:**
1. **Success Rate Tracking**: Per retailer, per product
2. **Price History Visualization**: Trends and anomalies
3. **Error Classification**: Network, parsing, validation issues
4. **Alert System**: Email/webhook notifications for failures
5. **Performance Metrics**: Response times, resource usage

## Phase 4: Market Intelligence ðŸ“Š

### Competitive Analysis Features
1. **Price Comparison Matrix**: Best deals across retailers
2. **Seasonal Trend Analysis**: Prime Day, Black Friday patterns
3. **Stock Level Monitoring**: Availability tracking
4. **New Product Detection**: Automatic catalogue updates

### Affiliate Integration Preparation
1. **Link Management**: Centralized affiliate URL handling
2. **Commission Tracking**: Revenue potential analysis
3. **Conversion Optimization**: Best-performing retailer identification
