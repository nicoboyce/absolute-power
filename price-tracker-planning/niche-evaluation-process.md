# Niche Evaluation Process

## Overview

Systematic evaluation framework for price tracking niches, emphasising information advantage and market structure analysis.

## Stage 1: Quick Screening (Pass/Fail)

### Minimum Viable Criteria
**Pass all 4 or eliminate immediately:**

2. **Clear Product Identity**: Unambiguous model numbers/specs
3. **Research Behaviour**: People actively compare before buying
4. **Multiple Retailers**: At least 3 UK stockists available

## Stage 2: Market Structure Analysis (Weighted 40%)

### Supplier Landscape (15 points max)
- **Ideal (12-15)**: 4-8 major brands, clear differentiation
- **Good (8-11)**: 3-4 dominant + several smaller players  
- **Poor (4-7)**: 10+ brands or 1-2 monopolistic players
- **Fail (0-3)**: Hundreds of suppliers, commodity market

### Retailer Concentration (15 points max)

## Stage 3: Information Advantage Potential (Weighted 30%)

### Technical Complexity Gap (20 points max)
**Assess consumer understanding vs product complexity:**

- **Massive gap (16-20)**: Complex technical specs, consumers confused
  - Example: Power station chemistry, inverter types, battery cycles
- **Large gap (12-15)**: Some technical aspects poorly understood
  - Example: Camera sensor sizes, lens optical quality
- **Medium gap (8-11)**: Basic technical knowledge exists
- **Small gap (4-7)**: Most consumers understand key specs
- **No gap (0-3)**: Simple products, obvious differences

### Educational Content Opportunities (10 points max)
- **Excellent (8-10)**: Can create comprehensive buying guides, spec explanations
- **Good (6-7)**: Some educational content possible
- **Limited (3-5)**: Basic comparisons only
- **None (0-2)**: Purely price-driven market

## Stage 4: Purchase Psychology (Weighted 20%)

### Consideration Level (10 points max)
- **High (8-10)**: Weeks/months research, specific model targeting

- **Good (6-7)**: £25-50 commission per sale
- **Fair (3-5)**: £10-25 commission per sale
- **Poor (0-2)**: <£10 commission per sale

## Stage 6: Competition Assessment (Bonus/Penalty)

### Existing Price Comparison Sites
- **None exists**: +5 bonus (blue ocean)
- **1 weak competitor**: +3 bonus (opportunity)
- **1-2 strong competitors**: 0 (manageable)
- **3+ established players**: -5 penalty (red ocean)

### SEO Competition Level
- **Low competition keywords**: +3 bonus
- **Medium competition**: 0
- **High competition**: -3 penalty

## Scoring System

**Maximum Score: 100 points**
- Market Structure: 40 points
- Information Advantage: 30 points

- Revenue Potential: 10 points
- Competition Bonus/Penalty: ±8 points

**Thresholds:**
- **80+ points**: Exceptional opportunity, proceed immediately
- **65-79 points**: Strong opportunity, worth developing

## Risk Factors (Red Flags)

### Market Risk

## Next Steps Process

### For High-Scoring Niches (65+):
1. **Deep dive research**: Spend 2-3 days on detailed analysis
2. **Prototype single product**: Test scraping and data collection
3. **Content test**: Create one comprehensive buying guide
4. **Affiliate applications**: Apply to top 3 programs
5. **Go/no-go decision**: Based on practical testing results

### For Medium-Scoring Niches (50-64):
1. **Monitor and revisit**: Check quarterly for market changes
2. **Partial research**: Keep notes but don't invest heavily
3. **Opportunity watch**: Look for new suppliers or market shifts

This framework systematically evaluates every factor we've identified as crucial for success, with emphasis on the information advantage and market structure insights.
